LDK
===

Ludum Development Kit. A game kit for rapidly prototyping games for game jams like Ludum Dare.
At this point it is not ready for anything more serious than a 48-hour game jam, but will hopefully get better with the time.
A total overhaul including custom OpenGL drawing and Scala support is scheduled for the new year.

Branches
==
All development is currently happening in the develop branch.
The master branch the supposed to be stable but also currently void of features. 
The develop branch is merged into the master branch at every new release.
