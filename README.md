LDK

Ludum Development Kit. A game kit for rapidly prototyping games for game jams like Ludum Dare.
At this point it is not ready for anything more serious than a 48-hour game jam, but will hopefully get better with the time.
A total overhaul including custom OpenGL drawing and Scala support is scheduled for the new year.
